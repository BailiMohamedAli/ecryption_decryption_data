# ecryption_decryption_data
this is a small reusable code lib for data encryption basic system

## steps to use
- first run the createKeypairs.js file in the node js envirement: it will create the key needed to encrypt and decrypt data
- node if you lose those keys and you have data in DB you can no longer decrypt that data so keep then safe and never upload them to the net
- run you app :
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
## enjoy !
